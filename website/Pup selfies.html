<p> Selfies are my favorite. I might not look like it in the picture on the left but as you can see from the picture below, I am great at posing. I have made it into hundreds of pictures in my two years living with the Blairs. Sometimes it gets annoying though cause I am pretty sure they use me for likes on instagram.</p>
