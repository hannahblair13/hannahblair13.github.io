	<p>My family is the greatest family ever. There are 7 of us, Hannah, Mitchell, Skylar, Mom, Dad, Punch, and Myself.</p>
	<p>Hannah is probably my favorite owner. She was the one who gave me the name Oakley, and when I was a tiny little energetic puppy she would take me for 3 walks a day. That's so many walks. One day I helped her pack up the trunk of mom's car and move alllll the way to Orono. I did the math, it takes 3 hours to drive there, not fun. When Hannah is gone at school Skylar and I stay in her bed because we miss her so much. Sometimes Mitchell calls Hannah on facetime and I get excited because I hear her voice and think that she is home. Sadly she only comes home for a few days every couple of months now. </p>
	<p>Mitchell is my buddy. He scratches my belly and gives me hugs when Punch tries to bite me. Punch was just getting used to being the only dog when I came around and basically ruined his life, so he tries to bite me a lot. Skylar is fun sometimes, but she kicks me in her sleep. Sometimes I'm pretty sure she gets me mistaken with a horse. </p>
