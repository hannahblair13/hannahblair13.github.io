		<p>Hello I am Oakley. I am a two year old black lab who lives in Waterboro, Maine.This website is to tell everyone a little bit more about me, I mean let's face it I deserve to be shown off.</p>
		<p>I was a christmas present for the Blair family when I was a little puppy and they have got to watch me grow <strong> SO </strong> much in the past two years. I love to go for car rides even though I end up scared every time the car starts to move. </p>
		<p> I live with my mom and dad, Jen and Loren, and my siblings Mitchell and Skylar. Hannah used to live with me but she moved out to go to college at the University of Maine. I also live with another dog, his name is Punch and he is a grumpy old man.</p>
